Data Analysis Project: Vendor Performance & Sales Insights

Proud to share my recent Data Analysis project focused on evaluating Vendor Performance based on Sales data â€” a real-world inspired use case that simulates how businesses track and optimize vendor efficiency and revenue contribution.

ðŸ“Š In this project:

I worked on a structured Sales dataset containing vendor-wise transactions.

Performed data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using tools like Excel / Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.).

Analyzed key metrics like Total Sales, Average Order Value, Vendor Contribution %, Monthly Trends, and Performance Ranking.

Built interactive graphs and charts to gain deep insights into which vendors are driving growth and which need strategic improvement.


âœ… This kind of analysis helps companies:

Identify top-performing vendors

Negotiate better terms with underperformers

Forecast sales based on historical vendor trends

Make data-driven procurement decisions
